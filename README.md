# Lumala_demo
By using Deep Neural Networks trained on human speech, Watson can produce natural-sounding and smooth voice quality. To distinguish your brand, work with IBM to train a voice that suits your distinct style with as little as one hour of audio. Use your own voice to adjust for misplaced pauses, awkward inflections or a general unnatural feel. In this demo, I will be modeling several components for learning purposes.
